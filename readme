Done
	Implement height and pressure functions (Calcluate height no matter what, if U or p calculate U)
	Rename period_ -> tau_
	Remove findWaveNumber()
	Implement air behaviour for all fields
	Remove A_
	g_ -> G_ and kVec_ -> K_
	Test on waveTank2D
	Does it still require phi<0 for control of alpha? Yes, but maybe use (n & u) > 0 instead of phi > 0? How to control volume fraction?
	Implement writing a Fourier file and reading from it if it exists.
	Change .use of old-style cast.
	Add writing out of error from root finding routine
	Test with interFoam 2.1.1 and 1.7.1
	Allow mean water depth at other height than z = 0;
	Implement automatic default choices for nModes and nHsteps
	Make sure that all constructors are correctly defined (compare e.g. with advective)
	Choose what to write with the write member method

Todo
	Make independent of gsl by conding as fenton.m script
	Make fenton() an independent library
	Make a interfoam test case and a navalfoam test case
	Copy gsl routines to local directory to make it independent of external libraries
	Make solitary wave case (looong wavelengt)
	Maybe implement advanced ramping up with results from nHsteps.
	Maybe implement cutting of faces
	Maybe make independent of gsl
	Update documentation in header
	Share: Upload to github and announce on cfd-online
