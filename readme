fentonWave - A stream function wave boundary condition for OpenFOAM
===================================================================

This is an OpenFOAM boundary condition class for generation of stream function waves.
It is intended for use with interFoam type solvers in coastal and offshore applications.
The implementation for the Fourier approximation of the stream function waves follows
closely the describtion in section 3.1.2 of the paper by J.D. Fenton, "Numerical
Methods for Nonlinear Waves" (1999), Numerical Methods for Nonlinear Waves,
Advances in Coastal and Ocean Engineering, Vol. 5, pp241-324. Equation numbers in
the code refer to this paper. At the time of writing the paper could be downloaded

Installation
============		

Compiled as a library libFentonWaveBC.so in the FOAM_USER_LIBBIN using 'wmake libso'.

Prior to compilation you must ensure that you have the GSL (Gnu Scientific Library) 
installed on your computer. The source can be downloaded from here:

ftp://ftp.gnu.org/gnu/gsl/

After downloading GSL install it by following the instructions in the INSTALL file.

You must also export an environmental variable, GSL_DIR, containing the path to the GSL 
installation such that the following files exist:

$GSL_DIR/include/gsl/gsl_vector.h 
$GSL_DIR/include/gsl/gsl_multiroots.h
$GSL_DIR/lib/libgsl.so
$GSL_DIR/lib/libgslcblas.so

After running 'wmake libso' from the fentonWave directory GSL_DIR may be unset.

Todo
====

- Make independent of gsl by coding as fenton.m script?
- Make fenton() an independent library?
- Copy gsl routines to local directory to make it independent of external libraries
- Maybe implement advanced ramping up with results from nHsteps.
- Maybe implement cutting of faces
- Maybe make independent of gsl
